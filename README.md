## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 📦 Git LFS

Make sure you have [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) (`brew install git-lfs`) installed before cloning. If you get errors when building you might be working with LFS references instead of downloaded images. Install git-lfs and re-clone the repo.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Private fork development

If you're a Val Town employee, working on a super secret blog post, here's how to develop on this repo in secret:

1. `git lfs install`
2. Create a new branch off the main of this public blog repo `git checkout -b super-secret-branch`
3. Add the private fork as a remote: `git remote add private https://github.com/val-town/private-blog.git`
4. Push the new branch to the private fork: `git push private super-secret-branch`
5. Develop in secret on the private fork
6. When you're ready to publish, create a public remote on the private repo: `git remote add public https://github.com/val-town/val-town-blog.git`
7. Push the branch to the public repo: `git push public super-secret-branch`
8. Open a PR from the public repo to the main branch of the public blog repo
